# 📊 Data Insights Lab
Business Intelligence use cases crafted with open data, insights, and practical applications.

**By Victor Gubaydullin**

This is my portfolio of practical BI solutions, focused on solving real business problems through data, dashboards, and automated reporting.

Each project in this lab is built around a **realistic use case**:
- using open business-related datasets,
- designing dashboards and gaining insights tailored to the actual needs of key decision-making business roles,
- and delivering structured, modular data pipelines.
